# QOLAE HR Compliance Dashboard Workflow
**Complete HR Compliance Management for All QOLAE Personnel**

---

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The HR Compliance Dashboard (`hrcompliance.qolae.com`) is a **standalone, secure system** that manages the complete HR compliance process for all QOLAE personnel - Readers, Case Managers, Admin staff, and any new starters. It operates independently from operational dashboards but integrates seamlessly with the overall QOLAE ecosystem.

### **Key Principles:**
- üîê **Security First** - Separate database (`qolae_hrcompliance`) for sensitive HR data
- üö´ **Minimal Email** - WebSocket notifications instead of email bombardment
- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates** - Instant notifications across dashboards
- üìä **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of all compliance activities
- üéØ **Management Only** - Liz has exclusive access to compliance data
