# üìã STEP 1A: AGENT COORDINATION & TROUBLESHOOTING HUB

**Purpose**: Central place for all agents to coordinate, ask questions, report blockers, and track progress

**Last Updated**: October 18, 2025 
**Status**: ACTIVE - Agents working in parallel

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES (Review Before Starting!)

1. **Copy files directly to Live Server** ssh root@91.99.184.77 ‚Üí `/var/www/hrcompliance.qolae.com/`
2. **Save using ecosystem.config PM2 process** every time to prevent cache issues
3. **Test Server side** after each major change
4. **Follow Location Block Protocol** - organize code by workflow, not technical function
5. **Use existing QOLAE patterns** - don't reinvent the wheel
6. **Reference STEP1A_API_CONTRACT.md** for all endpoint specs (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)

## ‚ùì Q&A SECTION

### **For Frontend-Specialist (Stream A)**

**Q1**: Should the registration form modal open in a separate window or inline on the dashboard?
**A**: Inline modal on the "New Starters" tab. See `readersRegistrationModal.ejs` for the pattern you should follow.

**Q2**: When the PIN is generated and displayed, should I auto-copy it to clipboard?
**A**: Yes! Include a "Copy to Clipboard" button next to the PIN. Use pattern from existing code.

**Q3**: For the display list, what columns exactly do I need?
**A**: Name, Email, Role, Status (badge), Date Created, Actions (View, Resend Email, Mark Complete)

**Q4**: How often should the display list auto-refresh?
**A**: Every 5 seconds via WebSocket subscription to `new_starter_compliance_submitted` event. See `websocket-client.js` for pattern.

---

### **For Auth-Specialist (Stream B)**

**Q1**: Do I need to create a new controller file or add to existing NewStarterController.js?
**A**: Add the 4 route handlers to `routes/newStarterRoute.js`. Update `NewStarterController.js` if needed for logic.

**Q2**: What's the rate limiting library you recommend?
**A**: Use `express-rate-limit` pattern or implement manually with Redis if available. If not, use in-memory store with timestamp tracking.

**Q3**: For OTP email, should I use sendNewStarterInvitation.js pattern?
**A**: Yes! Create similar utility file `utils/sendNewStarterOTP.js` following the same email service pattern.

**Q4**: Where should I store the OTP and otp_expires_at temporarily?
**A**: In the `new_starters` table columns. These fields already exist in the schema.

---

### **For Data-Specialist (Stream C)**

**Q1**: Should new_starter_documents and new_starter_references be in qolae_hrcompliance or qolae_casemanagers database?
**A**: Both new tables in `qolae_hrcompliance`. Only `workspace_access_rules` goes in `qolae_casemanagers`.

**Q2**: Where exactly should files be stored?
**A**: `/var/www/api.qolae.com/central-repository/new-starters/{PIN}/{document_type}/` - this mirrors Readers pattern.

**Q3**: Do I need virus scanning for uploaded files?
**A**: Optional for now. Focus on core functionality. If needed, add ClamAV integration later.

**Q4**: How does the workspace_access field in new_starters table relate to workspace_access_rules?
**A**: `workspace_access` in new_starters = current level (limited/full). `workspace_access_rules` = configurable per-feature permissions. For now, keep it simple.

## üö´ BLOCKER REPORTS

### **Format for Reporting Blockers**:
```
**BLOCKER REPORT**
Agent: [Stream A/B/C]
Task: [Task number and name]
Severity: üî¥ Critical | üü† High | üü° Medium | üü¢ Low
Issue: [Clear description of what's stuck]
Error Message: [If applicable, include full error]
What I've tried: [What you've already attempted]
Needed to proceed: [What info/help you need]
```

### **Active Blockers**:

*(None reported yet)*

## üîÑ CROSS-AGENT DEPENDENCIES

### **Stream A (Frontend) Depends On:**
- ‚úÖ Backend API endpoints exist (Atlas/Atlas agents built these)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket client ready (Mercury needs to finish this - using existing code for now)
- ‚è≥ Stream B: PIN/OTP endpoints (needed for testing registration flow)
- ‚è≥ Stream C: Database tables (needed for data to display in lists)

### **Stream B (Auth) Depends On:**
- ‚úÖ Database schema exists (Atlas built this)
- ‚úÖ Email service (nodemailer configured)
- ‚è≥ Stream C: Database tables complete (for storage)

### **Stream C (Data) Depends On:**
- ‚úÖ Database exists (qolae_hrcompliance, qolae_casemanagers)
- ‚úÖ Central repository directory exists
- No dependencies on Streams A or B

### **Integration Points (After All Streams)**:
- Frontend must call Backend endpoints (A ‚Üí B)
- Backend must store/retrieve from Database (B ‚Üí C)
- Frontend must display Database data (A ‚Üê C)

---

## üìù PROGRESS UPDATES

### **Update Format**:
```
**PROGRESS UPDATE**
Agent: [Stream A/B/C]
Timestamp: [HH:MM]
Completed: [What you just finished]
Current: [What you're working on now]
Next: [What you'll do next]
