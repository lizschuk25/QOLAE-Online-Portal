✅ QOLAE Infrastructure Progress Summary – 3 August 2025  with @geniusguide 
🎯 Overall Focus:
Consolidating core logic and services under api.qolae.com to establish a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for the entire QOLAE Portal System.
🔧 System-wide Achievements
✅ Centralised the API:
api.qolae.com is now the trusted SSOT
Handles all document generation, email logic, attachments, and soon: 2-way verification
WebSocket (qolae-websocket1) and Fastify (qolae-api-dashboard) now run on ports 3003 and 3000 respectively
✅ Cleaned and Activated Live API:
Fixed .env and SMTP credentials
Corrected createTransporter() to createTransport() in emailController.js
Verified that the API correctly:
Sends emails
Attaches TOB, CV, and CaseStudies
Logs cleanly via PM2

🖥️ Subdomain Status:
| Subdomain           | Status                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `admin.qolae.com`   | ✅ Fully working: Login, Lawyer registration, TOB generation, WebSocket-based status updates, email sending   |
| `lawyers.qolae.com` | ✅ Login Portal stable and interactive (pending final verification handling)                                  |
| `LawyersDashboard`  | 🛠️ Route conflict resolved; now paused. You confirmed `authRoute.js` no longer declares `/LawyersDashboard` |
| `api.qolae.com`     | ✅ Acts as SSOT for shared services and is ready to handle full 2-way verification                            |

🔐 Security Architecture Milestone
Decided to migrate all 2-way verification logic (email + WebAuthn) to api.qolae.com
Created the qolae-auth-api-map.md document detailing:
All endpoints for /api/auth and /api/webauthn
Database and route structure
Folder layout for scalable auth services
🧠 PostgreSQL Strategy
Realised that PostgreSQL is best left at the server level, but:
Access should be restricted to api.qolae.com
LawyersDashboard now has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database
Discussed future-proofing with separate DB users (lawyers_user, admin_user) and .env variables per subdomain

🧾 Notes
Duration: ~12 hours of focused restructuring
Mood: Exhausted but deeply aligned with architectural truth 😌
Outcome: QOLAE now has a scalable, secure, and unified backend — the foundation for everything that comes next.

Absolutely! 🎉 You've made incredible progress today, and the teamwork has been fantastic. Here's a comprehensive summary of what we achieved:
🚀 Major Architectural Breakthroughs
1. SSOT (Single Source of Truth) Architecture Established
Centralized API Dashboard (api.qolae.com) now serves as the core SSOT
Database gateway pattern implemented - all subdomains will call APIs instead of direct database access
Security-first approach - no more direct database credentials in frontend applications
2. Database Architecture Clarified
PostgreSQL remains at server root (as you designed)
API Dashboard becomes the database gateway for all services
Separate databases maintained for Admin and Lawyers dashboards
Centralized connection management through databaseManager.js
✅ Working Systems Confirmed
Admin Dashboard ✅
Email sending with attachments working
Document generation functional
WebSocket integration stable
Lawyers Registration Portal ✅
Registration workflow complete
Database integration working
Lawyers Tracking Database ✅
All tracking functionality operational
Document management working
WebSocket Server ✅
Real-time communication stable
Email and document workflows functional
🔧 Technical Improvements Made
API Dashboard Enhanced
Database manager created for multi-database access
Enhanced email routes with full workflow logic
Email verification table setup endpoint added
Environment configuration standardized
Lawyers Dashboard Fixed
Duplicate route conflict resolved
Database connection corrected to use lawyers_user
Module loading issues debugged and fixed
WebSocket Server Updated
Centralized API calls instead of local utils
Axios integration for API communication
Document generation now calls centralized API
🎯 Key Architectural Decisions Made
Security Architecture
API-first approach - all database access through APIs
Centralized authentication and authorization
No direct database access from frontend applications
Database Strategy
Keep existing databases at server root
API Dashboard as gateway to all databases
Gradual migration approach (low risk)
Service Communication
HTTP APIs for all cross-service communication
WebSocket server calls centralized APIs
Consistent error handling across services

🌟 What Made Today Special
You've successfully evolved from a collection of separate applications to a cohesive, secure, and scalable system architecture. The SSOT approach you've implemented will make future development much faster and more reliable.

4TH AUGUST 2025 CHECKLIST COMBINATION 

## ✅ QOLAE LawyersDashboard – Central Checklist for PostgreSQL + 2FA (via api.qolae.com)

This checklist is for @geniusguide to support Liz with PostgreSQL setup, verification flow, and JWT security logic. It is focused **only** on the 2-Way Verification infrastructure for the LawyersDashboard, with `api.qolae.com` as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

---

### 🗂️ PHASE 1 — PostgreSQL Table Creation

* [ ] Create new `lawyer_verification_tokens` table (in `lawyers-dashboard_production` or shared DB)

  * [ ] `id` (primary key, serial)
  * [ ] `lawyer_email` (text, not null)
  * [ ] `pin` (optional string)
  * [ ] `jwt_token` (optional string)
  * [ ] `expires_at` (timestamp)
  * [ ] `verified` (boolean, default: false)
  * [ ] `created_at` (timestamp, default now())
* [ ] Decide: store in `qolae_production` or `lawyers_dashboard_production`?

---

### 🔐 PHASE 2 — API Endpoint: `/api/verification/initiate`

* [ ] Create route to accept email or PIN input
* [ ] Validate against existing lawyers in DB
* [ ] Generate JWT token or PIN
* [ ] Insert new row into `lawyer_verification_tokens`
* [ ] Return response with expiry timestamp

---

### ✅ PHASE 3 — API Endpoint: `/api/verification/validate`

* [ ] Receive submitted PIN or token
* [ ] Validate existence + expiry
* [ ] Mark row as `verified: true` if successful
* [ ] Return user data + redirect (or error message)

---

### 🔄 PHASE 4 — Token & Security Logic

* [ ] Token expiry logic (15 mins or 1-time use)
* [ ] JWT secret loading from `.env`
* [ ] GDPR-compliant logging of access attempts
* [ ] Optional: log IP address, timestamp, and failed attempts

---

### 🧪 PHASE 5 — Integration Testing

* [ ] Test login initiation flow (Frontend ➜ API ➜ DB)
* [ ] Test successful and failed verification attempts
* [ ] Test token expiry timeout
* [ ] Test redirection after verification (to /LawyersDashboard)

---

### 📦 PHASE 6 — Deployment & Final Wiring

* [ ] Cursor Claude: merge backend route logic across ports 3002 & 3004
* [ ] ClaudeAI: finalise dynamic email with PIN/token from DB
* [ ] GeniusGuide: confirm SSOT PostgreSQL access and Prisma config
* [ ] Update Nginx + .env variables if needed
