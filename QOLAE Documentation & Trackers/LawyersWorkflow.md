LAWYERS WORKFLOW STEPS

The lawyers request CV and  Terms of Business. Liz also adds Case Studies. This is sent through the Admin-Dashboard project process from the Lawyers Tracking Database.

Introductory Email sent to them once checkboxes are ticked on Liz‚Äôs Lawyer Tracking Database.

Once Lawyer decides to engage Liz, they click on the ‚Äòclickable link‚Äô in their email.

This link takes the Lawyer to the QOLAE Login portal for a 2way/multi-factor login process. Once the Lawyer verifies with the 6 digit number, they are directed to a secure login page, which has their PIN already entered. They will need to enter their email details and a password. 

Once they have confirmed their login details, the Lawyer enters the Lawyers Dashboard and their own personal Workspace for them and their Law Firm. This Dashboard opens out to a Welcome container, a Workflow Progress (with a progress meter) container and 6 Workflow Cards. 

The first workflow card: Terms of business is the first step - the Door to this workflow card. The Lawyer clicks on the ‚ÄúReview & Sign Terms‚Äù button and this generates an automated customised TOB document with 13 out of the 16 fields auto populated - this happens silently behind the scenes. The Lawyer then goes through 4 workflow steps as this opens up to a Modal page,  which has 4 steps at the top of the navigation bar of this modal.a) Email Notification and preference opt in/opt out checkboxes/buttons which sends emails after each gateway point, if opted in. [I foresee there will be congratulatory visual cues, pop up messages, bell or musical sounds after every successful workflow stage.(ON THE MAIN LAWYERS DASHBOARD SEEMS MORE REALISTIC)

      b)  Digital Signature: The Lawyer signs their signature which is on a draw signature 			canvas or they have the option to upload their own digital signature and this is 			saved. Options to cancel and restart the process are available.

	Once the Lawyer signs, Liz‚Äôs signature is automatically added to the TOB document  	to complete this process (from central-repository/signatures). 

     c)	Preview Signed: Lawyer is able to preview the signed document so that they can 			see their signature and Liz's signature in the document. (Ideally it would be great for 	the conversion to pdf to happen here so that this is what the Lawyer sees).

     d)	Completion: Completion of this workflow shows completion and  the Lawyer clicks 		on the Return to Dashboard button (a pop up message to say the Terms of 			business has been signed successfully will appear) and returns them back to the 			dashboard. 
	
	Behind the scenes currently the html document is converted to a pdf and saved to 		qolae_lawyers db and also to the Documents Library. 
	The completion of this process communicates to the Lawyers Dashboard to update 		the database, the ‚ÄúYour Workflow Progress‚Äù panel for the 1st progress button to be 		changed from ‚ÄúTerms Signing‚Äù to ‚ÄúSigned‚Äù and then ticked. Also the progress meter 		moves towards step 2 of this panel.  

	This completion also signals to the Lawyers Dashboard to open the next Workflow 		card - ‚ÄúComplete Payment.‚Äù This completes the whole Terms of Business 	Workflow 	card process. 7.    Once back on the Lawyers Dashboard the ‚ÄúReview & Sign Terms‚Äù has now 
       become a ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù button. Clicking on this opens up to a Modal of View 		   
       Signed Document and a Download signed pdf document buttons which should work 	  
       accordingly. 

8.    The next gate is now open and the Lawyer is directed to the payment section and the 
       2nd Payment Workflow Modal Card. A services drop down needs to made available 
       (in a modal that opens to show this as these will have prices attached to them 
       and determine whether costs need to be upfront or 75% of the total. There is 
       only one choice at this stage to pay by Direct Banking. 75% of the upfront 
       fee is requested for INA‚Äôs and an email and receipt is automatically updated 
       and available on this workflow card. NOTE: on the Finance side, QBO (looking 
       at how this can be automated so that the system updates for the next gate to be
       opened).

     The Lawyers Dashboard‚Äôs  ‚ÄúYour Workflow Progress‚Äù panel meter, flows towards step    
      2 and the payment step is ticked and flow meter moves half way towards step 3.


9.   This next Workflow Card is the 3rd Client Consent Form Workflow Modal Card,
      which needs to be completed by the Lawyer.This Consent form Patient/Client/
      Services User details are filled out by the Lawyer. Name, date of birth, Address, 
      telephone number and email address. NOTE: This triggers an automatic population 
     of all forms across the system. So as to prevent repetition. 

     There is a ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù button for the Lawyer to look at the form prior to filling it out, if they     choose. There is also an ‚ÄúUpload Law Firm‚Äôs Consent Form‚Äù (this needs to meet with Liz‚Äôs Consent Policy). Once Lawyer clicks on ‚ÄúComplete Consent Form‚Äù and completes it, they will be able to download it, print off and send off in the post if the Client wants this.

Lawyers can review the email that is sent with the consent form to the Client, once they have filled it out and there is a tick box which they then tick and the email and consent form are sent to client. 

The Lawyers Dashboard‚Äôs  ‚ÄúYour Workflow Progress‚Äù panel meter, flows towards step    
 4 and the Consent Form step is ticked and flow meter moves half way towards step 4.


10.The Next gate opens on completion of the Consent form Modal Workflow card  and the Lawyer is directed to the 4th Case Referral & Instructions Form Workflow Modal Card. This has already been populated with the Client‚Äôs details and so the Lawyer just fills in their instructions and answers a few questions on this form. 


11. The Documents Library Workflow Modal Card is the 5th workflow card and where the Lawyer can upload their in-house instruction form if necessary. Medical notes, documents, Letters, pictures and videos can also be uploaded..

**NOTE: the ability to scan and digitise any forms that are uploaded and placed onto the portal will be made capable.**

12.**NOTE: Liz/Case Manager‚Äôs will not be able to access the medical notes or confidential information of the Client until consent has been received!!!! So the system closes this part of the portal off until consent has arrived. Lawyer‚Äôs will be red flagged about this on the system, so that they are aware.**

13.The lawyer will have access to the portal with the Law firm specific pin, a username and password. They can check for status updates within the portal. 

14.Once consent has been verified and returned to the portal, Liz‚Äôs automatic signature will be applied and the Lawyer can download this consent form for their case notes. 

15. A Final completion email is then sent to the Lawyer.  

SUMMARY: 
Across the workflows I would like some visual messages to distract from boredom and encouraged inspire an efficient and consistent workflow. See below: 

Examples of Congratulatory Visual Messages
Default Setting: Display visual confirmations after each step in the portal, such as:
üéâ ‚ÄúCongratulations! Step 1 Complete: Terms of Business Signed.‚Äù
‚úÖ ‚ÄúNext Step: Make Payment.‚Äù
